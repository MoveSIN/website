You can check out the listing on the ESA website here.\n\nMovement ecology is the field of understanding and predicting animal movement. It typically involves the analysis of data from animal-mounted sensors such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and other telemetry devices, as well as from non-spatial sources such as accelerometers and magnetometers. Movement ecology typically falls into broad categories that include space use and home ranges, resource and step selection analyses, movement predictions, and behavioural classification.\nAnimal movement data provides a rich source of information to understand animal ecology, and has provided countless behavioural and ecological insights, but processing animal movement data can be challenging. There are a number of considerations when analysing animal movement data, and the growing number of conceptual and statistical approaches can make it hard to get started.\nAround Australia, researchers are applying exciting movement ecology tools and analysing animal movement datasets, which we aim to bring together through meetings, seminars and ‘bring-your-problem’ workshops. We hope this will help to create a collaborative network that will benefit both experienced researchers and those just embarking into movement ecology.\n\nWe aim to\n\nHold a meeting/seminar/workshop every month\nHost a symposium and/or at the ESA conference\nHave a social event at the ESA conference\nUse the MoveSIN to connect researchers working on similar problems\n\n\n\nGet in touch\nGeneral email: ausmovementecology@gmail.com\n\n\nCommittee Members\n\nScott Forrest, scottwforrest@gmail.com\nMitchell Cowan, mitchell.cowan@uwa.edu.au\nRhys Cairncross\nNiraj Meisuria\nSally Burgemeestre\nInka Veltheim\nThomas Newsome\nPatrick Finnerty\nJames Pay\nDylan Westaway\n\n\n\nJoin the Movement Ecology Special Interest Network\nSign-up here! https://forms.gle/XqZXXLH73XBN26QS7\n\n\nFollow us on Bluesky\nBluesky account: https://bsky.app/profile/ausmovementecology.bsky.social\nWe started the Movement Ecology Special Interest Network after the ESA 2024 conference in Melbourne and are keen to get new members.

    "text": "For this month’s MoveSIN meeting we will be discussing the following paper:\nHofmann, D. D., Cozzi, G., McNutt, J. W., Ozgul, A., & Behr, D. M. (2023). A three-step approach for assessing landscape connectivity via simulated dispersal: African wild dog case study. Landscape Ecology, 38(4), 981–998. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-023-01602-4\nContext\nDispersal of individuals contributes to long-term population persistence, yet requires a sufficient degree of landscape connectivity. To date, connectivity has mainly been investigated using least-cost analysis and circuit theory, two methods that make assumptions that are hardly applicable to dispersal. While these assumptions can be relaxed by explicitly simulating dispersal trajectories across the landscape, a unified approach for such simulations is lacking.\nObjectives\nHere, we propose and apply a simple three-step approach to simulate dispersal and to assess connectivity using empirical GPS movement data and a set of habitat covariates.\nMethods\nIn step one of the proposed approach, we use integrated step-selection functions to fit a mechanistic movement model describing habitat and movement preferences of dispersing individuals. In step two, we apply the parameterized model to simulate dispersal across the study area. In step three, we derive three complementary connectivity maps; a heatmap highlighting frequently traversed areas, a betweenness map pinpointing dispersal corridors, and a map of inter-patch connectivity indicating the presence and intensity of functional links between habitat patches. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed three-step approach in a case study in which we use GPS data collected on dispersing African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) inhabiting northern Botswana.\nResults\nUsing step-selection functions we successfully parametrized a detailed dispersal model that described dispersing individuals’ habitat and movement preferences, as well as potential interactions among the two. The model substantially outperformed a model that omitted such interactions and enabled us to simulate 80,000 dispersal trajectories across the study area.\nConclusion\nBy explicitly simulating dispersal trajectories, our approach not only requires fewer unrealistic assumptions about dispersal, but also permits the calculation of multiple connectivity metrics that together provide a comprehensive view of landscape connectivity. In our case study, the three derived connectivity maps revealed several wild dog dispersal hotspots and corridors across the extent of our study area. Each map highlighted a different aspect of landscape connectivity, thus emphasizing their complementary nature. Overall, our case study demonstrates that a simulation-based approach offers a simple yet powerful alternative to traditional connectivity modeling techniques. It is therefore useful for a variety of applications in ecological, evolutionary, and conservation research.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Prof. Dr. Damien Farine\nEccellenza Professor, Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, University of Zurich Associate Professor, Division of Ecology and Evolution, Research School of Biology, Australian National University Affiliated Scientist, Department of Collective Behavior, Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior w: https://sites.google.com/site/drfarine/home\nPhysiological trade-offs and adaptive movement strategies in dispersal and collective movements Movement is inherently tied to physiology yet we know surprisingly little about the energetic costs individuals face during different movement contexts. While large-scale dispersal is expected to incur significant energetic demands, animals may use strategic behaviours to mitigate these costs. Likewise, collective movement—common in many group-living species—has raised questions about the physiological consequences of coordinating movements, maintaining cohesion, and leadership. Over the past decade, I have been conducting a large-scale GPS tracking study of wild vulturine guineafowl, a terrestrial and highly social bird. Using high-resolution (1 Hz) tracking data, we examined the movement costs of solitary dispersal and uncovered behavioural strategies that allow individuals to mitigate the energetic demands of making large-scale displacements. By comparing these solitary movements to group movements, we have also revealed inefficiencies and distinct costs associated with moving collectively. Furthermore, by implanting heart-rate loggers and tracking entire groups, we investigated the physiological consequences of leadership within groups ‘on the move’—revealing that leaders pay a cost when faced with competing directional preferences among group members. These findings highlight the importance of considering movement from both physiological and social perspectives, and the behavioural flexibility that animals can use to manage the energetic demands of movement.\nRecording can be found here: https://youtu.be/kpDKLdv9JU8\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
