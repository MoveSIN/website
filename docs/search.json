You can check out the listing on the ESA website here.\n\n\n\nMoveSIN Logo\n\n\nMovement ecology is the field of understanding and predicting animal movement. It typically involves the analysis of data from animal-mounted sensors such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and other telemetry devices, as well as from non-spatial sources such as accelerometers and magnetometers. Movement ecology typically falls into broad categories that include space use and home ranges, resource and step selection analyses, movement predictions, and behavioural classification.\nAnimal movement data provides a rich source of information to understand animal ecology, and has provided countless behavioural and ecological insights, but processing animal movement data can be challenging. There are a number of considerations when analysing animal movement data, and the growing number of conceptual and statistical approaches can make it hard to get started.\nAround Australia, researchers are applying exciting movement ecology tools and analysing animal movement datasets, which we aim to bring together through meetings, seminars and ‘bring-your-problem’ workshops. We hope this will help to create a collaborative network that will benefit both experienced researchers and those just embarking into movement ecology.\nWe aim to: Hold a meeting/seminar/workshop every 2-3 months Host a symposium at the ESA conference Have a social event at the ESA conference Use the SIN to connect researchers working on similar problems\n\nCommittee Members\nScott Forrest, scott.forrest@qut.edu.au Mitchell Cowan, mitchell.cowan@uwa.edu.au Inka Veltheim, inka.veltheim@deeca.vic.gov.au Patrick Finnerty, patrick.finnerty@sydney.edu.au James Pay, james.pay@utas.edu.au\n\n\nJoin the Movement Ecology Special Interest Network\nSign-up here!\nGeneral email: ausmovementecology@gmail.com\nBluesky account: https://bsky.app/profile/ausmovementecology.bsky.social\nWe started the Movement Ecology Special Interest Network after the ESA 2024 conference in Melbourne and are keen to get new members. Please join us if you have an interest in movement ecology!\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
