You can check out the listing on the ESA website here.\n\nMovement ecology is the field of understanding and predicting animal movement. It typically involves the analysis of data from animal-mounted sensors such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and other telemetry devices, as well as from non-spatial sources such as accelerometers and magnetometers. Movement ecology typically falls into broad categories that include space use and home ranges, resource and step selection analyses, movement predictions, and behavioural classification.\nAnimal movement data provides a rich source of information to understand animal ecology, and has provided countless behavioural and ecological insights, but processing animal movement data can be challenging. There are a number of considerations when analysing animal movement data, and the growing number of conceptual and statistical approaches can make it hard to get started.\nAround Australia, researchers are applying exciting movement ecology tools and analysing animal movement datasets, which we aim to bring together through meetings, seminars and ‘bring-your-problem’ workshops. We hope this will help to create a collaborative network that will benefit both experienced researchers and those just embarking into movement ecology.\n\nWe aim to\n\nHold a meeting/seminar/workshop every 2-3 months\nHost a symposium at the ESA conference\nHave a social event at the ESA conference\nUse the SIN to connect researchers working on similar problems\n\n\n\nGet in touch\nGeneral email: ausmovementecology@gmail.com\n\n\nCommittee Members\n\nScott Forrest, scottwforrest@gmail.com\nMitchell Cowan, mitchell.cowan@uwa.edu.au\nRhys Cairncross\nNiraj Meisuria\nSally Burgemeestre\nInka Veltheim\nThomas Newsome\nPatrick Finnerty\nJames Pay\nDylan Westaway\n\n\n\nJoin the Movement Ecology Special Interest Network\nSign-up here! https://forms.gle/XqZXXLH73XBN26QS7\n\n\nFollow us on social media\nBluesky account: https://bsky.app/profile/ausmovementecology.bsky.social\nWe started the Movement Ecology Special Interest Network after the ESA 2024 conference in Melbourne and are keen to get new members.

    "text": "Prof. Dr. Damien Farine\nEccellenza Professor, Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, University of Zurich Associate Professor, Division of Ecology and Evolution, Research School of Biology, Australian National University Affiliated Scientist, Department of Collective Behavior, Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior w: https://sites.google.com/site/drfarine/home\nPhysiological trade-offs and adaptive movement strategies in dispersal and collective movements Movement is inherently tied to physiology yet we know surprisingly little about the energetic costs individuals face during different movement contexts. While large-scale dispersal is expected to incur significant energetic demands, animals may use strategic behaviours to mitigate these costs. Likewise, collective movement—common in many group-living species—has raised questions about the physiological consequences of coordinating movements, maintaining cohesion, and leadership. Over the past decade, I have been conducting a large-scale GPS tracking study of wild vulturine guineafowl, a terrestrial and highly social bird. Using high-resolution (1 Hz) tracking data, we examined the movement costs of solitary dispersal and uncovered behavioural strategies that allow individuals to mitigate the energetic demands of making large-scale displacements. By comparing these solitary movements to group movements, we have also revealed inefficiencies and distinct costs associated with moving collectively. Furthermore, by implanting heart-rate loggers and tracking entire groups, we investigated the physiological consequences of leadership within groups ‘on the move’—revealing that leaders pay a cost when faced with competing directional preferences among group members. These findings highlight the importance of considering movement from both physiological and social perspectives, and the behavioural flexibility that animals can use to manage the energetic demands of movement.\nRecording can be found here: https://youtu.be/kpDKLdv9JU8\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
